abstract: "Road safety is a critical concern in urban environments. This paper presents a deep learning-based risk prediction system that leverages urban sensing data to enhance consumer driving safety. We collect real-time data from various sensors including cameras, GPS, and vehicle telematics to identify potential hazards. A deep neural network model is trained to predict accident risk levels based on environmental factors, traffic conditions, and driver behavior patterns. The system provides early warnings to drivers, enabling them to take preventive actions and avoid dangerous situations."

summary: "Presented at IEEE GCCE 2024, Kokura, Japan, October 29 - November 11, 2024."
