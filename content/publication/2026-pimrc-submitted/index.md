abstract: "This paper investigates the uplink federated distillation problem in wireless edge networks, where mobile devices collaborate to train a machine learning model without sharing raw data. We propose a channel-aware Stackelberg game framework to design incentive mechanisms that encourage user participation while considering wireless channel conditions. The leader (edge server) determines the reward structure, and followers (mobile devices) decide their participation levels based on communication costs and channel quality. Our approach jointly optimizes computation offloading, communication resource allocation, and incentive design to maximize system utility while ensuring fairness among participants with heterogeneous channel conditions."

summary: "**(First Author, Under Review)** Submitted to IEEE PIMRC 2026, Track 3: Mobile and Wireless Networks. Paper ID: 1571249437."

## Conference Information

**IEEE PIMRC 2026** (Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications) is a flagship annual international symposium that brings together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to discuss the latest advances in wireless communications and networking.

- **Track**: Track 3 - Mobile and Wireless Networks
- **Submission Date**: February 1, 2026
- **Paper ID**: 1571249437
- **Status**: Under Review

## Research Highlights

### Channel-Aware Incentive Design
Unlike traditional federated learning approaches that ignore wireless channel heterogeneity, our framework explicitly considers:
- Time-varying channel conditions
- Path loss and fading effects
- Interference from neighboring devices
- Uplink transmission costs

### Stackelberg Game Framework
- **Leader**: Edge server determines reward policies
- **Followers**: Mobile devices choose participation strategies
- **Equilibrium**: Optimal solution balancing system utility and fairness

### Key Innovations
🔹 **Channel-aware resource allocation** that adapts to wireless conditions  
🔹 **Federated distillation** for efficient knowledge transfer without raw data sharing  
🔹 **Incentive mechanism** that encourages participation while managing costs  
🔹 **Quality-of-Service guarantees** for heterogeneous devices

## Potential Applications

- **Edge AI**: Distributed machine learning at network edge
- **Smart Cities**: Collaborative sensing and data analytics
- **Healthcare**: Privacy-preserving medical data analysis
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Distributed model training for V2X communications
- **Industrial IoT**: Federated learning in manufacturing environments
