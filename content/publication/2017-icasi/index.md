abstract: "CarView is a live media streaming platform that enables vehicles on roads to share video streams with their neighbors in real-time. The system creates a dynamic peer-to-peer network among nearby vehicles, allowing drivers to access multiple viewpoints of the surrounding traffic environment. This enhanced visibility helps drivers make better decisions, especially in situations with limited line-of-sight. The platform addresses technical challenges including high node mobility, frequent topology changes, and limited network capacity. We implement and evaluate CarView on a testbed of instrumented vehicles, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness in real-world scenarios."

summary: "Presented at IEEE ICASI 2017, Sapporo, Japan."
