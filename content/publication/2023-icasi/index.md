abstract: "Trust management is essential for secure and reliable operation of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). This paper proposes a reliable trust-based topology control mechanism that enhances network security and energy efficiency. We develop a trust evaluation model that considers both direct interactions and indirect recommendations to assess node trustworthiness. Based on trust values, the topology control algorithm selectively establishes connections with reliable neighbors while isolating malicious or compromised nodes. The approach maintains network connectivity while reducing energy consumption and improving resilience against attacks."
