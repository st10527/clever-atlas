abstract: "Mobile crowdsensing has emerged as a powerful paradigm for large-scale data collection by leveraging smartphone users. This paper addresses the cooperative multi-user task allocation problem in social-based crowdsensing platforms. We consider both user social relationships and their sensing capabilities to design an efficient task assignment mechanism. The proposed approach uses social network analysis to identify influential users and employs a cooperative game theory framework to incentivize participation while ensuring fair task distribution among users."
