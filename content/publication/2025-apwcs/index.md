abstract: "This paper proposes a novel multi-UAV data collection system with in-flight wireless power transfer capability. Unlike traditional approaches where UAVs must land or return to base stations for recharging, our system enables UAVs to receive power wirelessly while in flight from dedicated charging UAVs. This capability significantly extends mission duration and operational range. We design a coordination protocol for data collection UAVs and charging UAVs, and develop an optimization algorithm to determine efficient flight paths and charging schedules."

summary: "Presented at IEEE VTS APWCS 2025, Tokyo, Japan."
