abstract: "Delay-tolerant networks (DTNs) enable communication in challenged environments where end-to-end connectivity is intermittent. This paper investigates message forwarding strategies using mobile ferries - special nodes with controlled mobility patterns. We analyze how ferry routes and buffer management policies affect message delivery performance. The proposed forwarding algorithm considers ferry schedules, message priorities, and contact opportunities to make intelligent forwarding decisions. Simulation results show that our approach achieves higher delivery rates and lower delays compared to conventional DTN routing protocols."
