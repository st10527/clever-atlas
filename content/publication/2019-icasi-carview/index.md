abstract: "CarView Plus is a social-based live media distribution platform designed for vehicular networks. The system enables drivers to share real-time video streams with nearby vehicles, creating a collaborative traffic awareness system. We leverage social network relationships to optimize content distribution, prioritizing streams from trusted sources. The platform addresses challenges of high mobility, limited bandwidth, and dynamic topology in vehicular environments. Field tests demonstrate that CarView Plus effectively disseminates live traffic information and enhances situational awareness for drivers."

summary: "Presented at IEEE ICASI 2019, Fukuoka, Japan."
