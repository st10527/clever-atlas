abstract: "In opportunistic networks, nodes exchange messages when they come into contact, relying on node mobility to eventually deliver messages to destinations. However, nodes have limited buffer capacity, making buffer management critical for network performance. This paper investigates data forwarding strategies under finite buffer constraints. We propose a priority-based buffer management scheme that considers message utility, remaining lifetime, and delivery probability. When buffer overflow occurs, the algorithm selectively drops messages to maximize overall delivery success rate. Performance evaluation shows significant improvements in delivery ratio and latency compared to traditional FIFO-based approaches."
