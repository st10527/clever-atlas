abstract: "This invention provides a map-based traffic situation detecting method, device, and non-transitory computer-readable medium with adaptively variable detecting scope. The system dynamically adjusts the traffic detection range based on traffic density, road characteristics, and user requirements. In congested areas, the system narrows the detection scope for more precise information; in sparse areas, it expands the range for broader coverage. This adaptive approach effectively balances information accuracy and coverage area while optimizing system resource utilization. The invention is applicable to various intelligent transportation systems and navigation applications."
